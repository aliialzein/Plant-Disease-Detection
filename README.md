# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Detection with Grad-CAM

This project detects plant diseases from leaf images using a fine-tuned MobileNetV2 deep learning model. It features an interactive web app built with Streamlit and provides Grad-CAM visualizations to highlight which parts of the leaf influenced the model's decision.

## ðŸ“¸ Demo

Upload a photo of a leaf and get:
- The predicted disease class
- A heatmap showing the model's focus

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Image classification using MobileNetV2
- âœ… Real-time predictions in a web app
- âœ… Grad-CAM visualization for model interpretability
- âœ… Lightweight and efficient for deployment

## ðŸ§  Model Info

- Trained on the [PlantVillage dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)
- Data augmented with rotation, zoom, flip, shift
- Fine-tuned on top 30 layers of MobileNetV2
- Saved as `best_model.h5`
